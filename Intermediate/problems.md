# Problem 1: Given an array of non-negative integers, count the number of unordered pairs of array elements such that their bitwise AND(&) is a power of 2.

For ex: for array [10,7,2,8,3]; there are 6 unordered pairs;
explaination:
10&7=2
10&2=2;
10&8=2;
10&3=2;
7&2=2;
2&3=2;

Constraints:
1<=n<=2\*10^5
0<=ar[i]<=2^12
